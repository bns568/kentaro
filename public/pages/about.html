            Los Angeles, CA (November 17, 2017) - Japanese-born Angeleno Kentaro Kameyama is
            the newest member of fashion’s “in” crowd as the winner of season 16 of Lifetime’s Emmy-nominated
            series “Project Runway". Kameyama clinched the coveted prize with his jaw-dropping runway show at
            New York’s Fashion Week, which featured models wearing expertly-tailored clothes inspired by
            classical music, walking to an original score composed by Kameyama. The fashion-forward collection
            impressed the show’s judges Heidi Klum, Nina Garcia, Zac Posen and this year’s finale guest judge,
            Jessica Alba. The collection was a featured spread in Marie Claire Magazine.
            Kameyama is a 2015 graduate of FCI – The Fashion School of Los Angeles, where he currently teaches
            and serves as Fashion Chairman. Also a classical pianist and composer, Kameyama has a Graduate
            Certificate in Piano Performance from the University of Southern California, an Artist Diploma
            from the University of Redland, Masters of Music from the University of South Carolina, Bachelor
