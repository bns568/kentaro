Greg,s Log......

I uploaded the carousel aka accordion style menu on accordion.html. Right now it is just picture slides.
   1. We can change speed and length width and such. 
   2. I will have to add links to it once I know what to use. 

Also I uploaded just as a maybe for our background... the scroll.html file. 

I added all the files to where I thought they would plus edited all the file source on the codes. 

I also added a GregDev folder where I was testing everything so those html files works within that folder as well. 

** So if you want to see the samples I made please open it in **
../GregDev/accordion.html 
../GregDev/scroll.html
